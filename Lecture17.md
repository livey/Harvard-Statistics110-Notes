Memoryless property of exponential distribution 
E(T|T>20) > E(T) 
If memeryless, we would have E(T|T>20)  = 20 + E(T). 

####Theorem If X a positve valued r.v. with memeryless property, then:
X~ Expo(\lambda), 

Proof.
Let F be the CDF of X, G(x) =P(X>x) = 1-F(x) 
memoryless property is G(s+t) = G(s)G(t)
