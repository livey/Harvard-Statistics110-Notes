Conditional probability. 
(1) try simple and extreme cases
(2) break up problem into simpler cases

law of total probability 
p(B)=\sum_i p(B,A_i)
    =\sum_i P(B|A_i)*P(A_i)
    

Patient gets tested for disease 
1 percent people afflicts that disease--interesting question

Biohazard:
1. confusing P(A|B) , P(B|A)

Sally Clark case 
2. Confuse prior and posterior
P(A|A)=1 , 

3. Confuse independent and conditional independent.
