(1)Conditioning : the soul of statistics 
(2)Random variables and their distribution 

Gambler's ruin problem: Two gamblers A and B, sequence round bets one 1 dollor. p=P(A wins at certain round) q=1-p; 
Find the probability that A wins all the games. Assuming A starts with i dollors and B starts with (N-i) dollors. 
Random walk: 
absorbing state at (0,N) 

Stratege: condition on the first step 
Let p_i=P(A wins game| A starts at i dollor) 

p_i = p*p_{i+1} + qp_{i-1} , with boundary 1<=i<=N-1; P_0 = 0 ; Pn=1; 

( difference equation ) 

Random variables
Define Bernoulli : A r.v. X is said to have Bern. distribution if X has 
two possible values 0 and 1. and P(X=1) = p. P(X=0) = 1-p =q; 

Binomial(n,p) The distribution of number of success in N independent Bernoulli trials. 
its distribution is given by 

P(X=K)= (n,k)p^k q^{n-1} 

PMF:probability mass function 
X~ Bin(n,p) Y~Bin(m,p) independent. X+Y ~ Bin(m+n,p) 
prove: consider Bernoulli trials.
