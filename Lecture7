(1)Conditioning : the soul of statistics 
(2)Random variables and their distribution 

Gambler's ruin problem: Two gamblers A and B, sequence round bets one 1 dollor. p=P(A wins at certain round) q=1-p; 
Find the probability that A wins all the games. Assuming A starts with i dollors and B starts with (N-i) dollors. 
Random walk: 
absorbing state at (0,N) 

Stratege: condition on the first step 
Let p_i=P(A wins game| A starts at i dollor) 

p_i = p*p_{i+1} + qp_{i-1} , with boundary 1<=i<=N-1; P_0 = 0 ; Pn=1;
